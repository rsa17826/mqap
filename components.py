# There are two optional parameters that are worth drawing attention to here: "game_name" and "supports_uri".
# As you might know, on a room page on WebHost, clicking a slot name opens your locally installed Launcher
# and asks you if you want to open a Text Client.
# If you have "game_name" set on your Component, your user also gets the option to open that instead.
# Furthermore, if you have "supports_uri" set to True, your Component will be passed a uri as an arg.
# This uri contains the room url + port, the slot name, and the password.
# You can process this uri arg to automatically connect the user to their slot without having to type anything.

# As you can see above, the MathQuest client has both of these parameters set.
# This means a user can click on the slot name of an MathQuest slot on WebHost,
# then click "MathQuest Client" instead of "Text Client" in the Launcher popup, and after a few seconds,
# they will be connected and playing the game without having to touch their keyboard once.

# Since a Component is just Python code, this doesn't just work with CommonClient-derived clients.
# You could forward this uri arg to your standalone C++/Java/.NET/whatever client as well,
# meaning just about every client can support this "Click on slot name -> Everything happens automatically" action.
# The author would like to see more clients be aware of this feature and try to support it.
